# Hugging Face Agents Course Exploration

I am currently exploring the [Hugging Face Agents Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course).

## Progress Overview

### Unit 1: LLM & Agent Foundations
This unit covered the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents:
- **LLM Basics:** Overview of "Attention Is All You Need", Transformers (Encoders, Decoders, Seq2Seq), and how they work.
- **Hugging Face Platform:** Setup and inference of Transformers.
- **Model Evolution:** Sequence of LLM models from different providers.
- **Training Pipeline:** Unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- **Agent Components:** Understanding the structure of AI agents: Thoughts, Actions, Observations, and Tool Calls.
- **Methodologies:** The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) approach, Chain of Thought (CoT), and the Observe cycle.
- **Integrations & Observability:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations and agent inspection using Langfuse.

### Unit 2: Smolagents Framework
The focus of Unit 2 is on the `smolagents` library:
- **CodeAgent:** The default agent type in `smolagents`.
- **Capabilities:** Building multi-agent systems and utilizing tools effectively.
